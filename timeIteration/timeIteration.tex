\noindent Essentially, we need to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the time derivative of the vector of disturbance variables 
    \item Calculate new vector of disturbances from old
    \item Calculate magnitudes of disturbances
    \item use a plot of the log of this magnitude against time to find the growth rate, $\lambda$ 
\end{itemize}

I am thinking that I will use variables which still contain the time dependence:

\begin{equation}
 (v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}) = (U,V,W) + (\su(t), \sv(t), \sw(t))e^{ikx}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    T_{ij} = C_{ij} + \delta c_{ij}(t) e^{ikx} 
\end{equation}
 

The main problem is working out how to deal with the equations and boundary conditions which do not contain a time derivative.

I remember you told me something about this but I have forgotten what it was! I can't see how to solve them separately from the other equations because there are more unknowns than equations, and I cannot solve them with the other equations because they set the time derivatives of u,v,w,p to zero.
